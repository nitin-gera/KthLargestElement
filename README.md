# KthLargestElement

This application finds the kth largest element in an unsorted array. 
Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element. 
Note: You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.

It uses Priority queue of C++ STL to achieve this goal.
